This is to build an interceptor to enable steering in Hyundia below 32 mph.
The interceptor has 2x CAN interface for filtering data going to MDPS and changing speed signals to be above 35 mph as long as OP engaged
Main components:
 STM32F105RCT6 microcontroller
 2x SN65HVD230DR CAN Transceivers
 AZ1117CH-3.3TRG1 Voltage regulator
